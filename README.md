## Goals of This Course
***
### Introduction to Github:

It is necessary for people to be able to share their work efficiently, and easily. This means: being able to make use of a service(e.g. Github) that is used widely, creating content which is easily understood, providing information that is readily available(commenting your code, etc.), and opening your work up to collaboration and criticism.

Students will become familiar with how to:
- create Github accounts 
- create new repositories
- join organizations
- commit to certain repositories 
- organize their projects properly
- create documentation that is easily understood and readily available
- contribute to repositories and projects

### Introduction to Programming

Writing programs is a skill, and an art. Programming is a tool. It is a way of "translating" human language and logic into computer language for the purpose of allowing the computer to do tasks for us. Computers due are myriad of magnitudes faster than us. Why not put them to amazing uses?

Students will learn certain concepts such as:
- how computers store and process information
- what variables are 
- what functions are and how we implement them
- how we give programs the choice of doing one thing over another
- how to repeat useful processes
- how to create, use, and access arrays
- how to create class and objects
- how to incorporate object-oriented design into their programs

There are many concepts, both large and small, that are not presented here for one of two reasons: (1)they may or not be covered, (2)and there are too may to list. The concepts listed above are the core of what we will be learning throughout the course. The most important concept of all, that we will learn and apply through this course, is the act of problem solving. Programming instills a certain "pillar of knowledge" inside of those that practice it; programmers learn how to break and boil down problems into their simplest forms and solve them with both basic and intricate solutions.

### Introduction to Processing and p5js

Processing is an open source programming language and environment (see the wiki for more info). The core of the language visual-centric. The programs that you will create become like tiny little worlds unto themselves. They have intricate inner workings and underlying principles that allow the objects in these worlds to interact. These principles and inner workings will be defined by you. Think of yourself as the master of your universe; each program you create will add another planet to that universe.

Students will learn the basics of Processing and p5js. They will also become familiar with how to implement much more difficult programing tasks such as object oriented design. Students will become familiar with 2-Dimensional graphics creation, as well as pixel manipulation. There are many projects that could be listed here, but they will not be. There is a multitude of projects at our disposal, but a selection will be made based upon the skills, knowledge, and progression of each class. The projects will be tailored to the skill of the class.
