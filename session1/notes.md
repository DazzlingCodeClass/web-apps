## Talking points
### Github
Github is a web based environment that is based of a much earlier system called Git. Git (and Github) store all the files for your projects with an added benefit: it tracks all the changes you make. Say, you add an awesome new navigation menu to your website, and for whatever reason it breaks the home page. People can't get to your site! You can "go back in time" with your project to the point before you added the new menu bar, and keep your site up and running while you fix the issue. Github also allows multiple people to add to, change up, and imrpove upon your code. The one catch is that any changes made have to be approved by the owner(s). People all over the world would be able to edit the code to your site or your mobile app to improve it or make it different in some way, shape or form. If you like what they changed, you could accept it. If you don't like their suggestion, you can also just reject it. That's the great thing about Github. It stores and tracks your projects, while allowing other people to make critiques and suggestions.
